# bloomfilter
A simple C++ library providing a few variations of Bloom filters.

## Description

Three types of Bloom filters are supported:

- Ordinary BFs
- Counting BFs
- Paired BFs (as seen in [Mick et al.][1])

The following operations are supported on all types:

- Insert
- Query
- Serialize
- Deserialize

There are also a few operations supported by particular types:

- Counting and paired BFs also support a Delete operation
- Ordinary and paired BFs also support a Union operation
- Counting BFs support conversion into ordinary BFs
- Ordinary BFs support conversion into paired BFs
- Ordinary BFs can be compressed using the halving method (as seen in [Wang et al.][2])

A few additional helper mechanisms may eventually be implemented:

- A helper to compute the optimal BF parameters given the number of content objects to be indexed
- Helpers to compute the probabilities of false positives for queries on existing populated BFs

Doxygen documentation can be compiled with `make docs`.

## Usage

Everything lives in the namespace `bloom`.

These classes are templated, so you must specify the type of the object you are indexing when you instantiate a Bloom filter. For example:

    OrdinaryBloomFilter<std::string> bf(4, 32);

This creates an ordinary BF with 4 hashes and a 32-bit array, capable of indexing strings.

You must specialize `std::hash` for `HashParams<T>` for each type `T` you wish to construct a BF for. The `HashParams` type is a structure consisting of the template parameter `T` and a `uint8_t`; the `uint8_t` serves as a salt, to allow multiple hashes to be generated for a single object (as per the semantics of a BF).

A helper class implementing a 32-bit FNV-1 hash is given in `FnvHash.hpp`. An example of how to specialize `std::hash` using it can be found in `tests/ordinary_insert_query.cpp`.

To insert an object `o` into the BF, call `bf.Insert(o)`, and to check for existence of an object, call `bf.Query(o)`. If using a CountingBloomFilter or PairedBloomFilter, you can remove items using `bf.Delete(o)`.

To serialize a BF into a `std::ostream` `os`, call `bf.Serialize(os)`. To deserialize a BF from a `std::istream` `is`, use the static function `Deserialize(is)` within the appropriate BF class.

For information about the other operations, refer to the Doxygen documentation or read the comments in the code.
